# üö¶ Smart Traffic Light
### üíª The Project for Coding Thailand 2025 - Regional Competition
This project is built for the Coding Thailand 2025 - Regional Competition to simulate and use AI to solve traffic problems.

Using Python and a webcam, the system employs the advanced YOLOv8 (nano version) object detection model to:
- Count persons and vehicles in real time at an intersection.
- Change traffic lights based on what it detected (person is top priority).

The goals for this project are to qualify for the **National round** and to practice my Python skills at the same time. When I enter the national round, I will make the Raspberry Pi version. However, the AI may have issues detecting persons and vehicles and needs improvement in the future.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup instruction

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
  - Clone default branch (main):
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NineNights195/smart-traffic-light.git
    ```
  - To clone specific branch:
    ```
    git clone -b <branch-name> https://github.com/NineNights195/smart-traffic-light.git
    ```

### 2. **Create Virtual Environment**
  - Go to your repo
    ```
    cd <your repo directory>
    ```
  - Create virtual enviroment to avoids messing up system Python
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

### 3. **Activate Virtual Environment**
  - Windows:
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 4. Ensure pip is avaliable
  - If pip is missing inside the venv, run:
    ```
    python -m ensurepip --upgrade
    ```

### 5. Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel
```
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 6. **Install Dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  - Requirements dependencies
    ```
    opencv-python
    numpy
    torch
    torchaudio
    torchvision
    ultralytics
    ultralytics-thop
    pandas
    pillow
    tqdm
    ```

### 7. Download YOLO model
- Create a folder called models inside your project (if it doesn‚Äôt exist yet):
  ```
  mkdir -p models
  ```
- Download the YOLOv8 nano model (yolov8n.pt) into the models/ directory:
  ```
  wget -O models/yolov8n.pt https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt
  ```
  Alternatively, if wget is not available, use curl:
  ```
  curl -L -o models/yolov8n.pt https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt
  ```

### 8. Test some scripts
- Now you can test some scripts in scripts folder
- Example the webcam-test.py
  ```
  python webcam-test.py
  ```
  Now it should work properly
